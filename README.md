## About The Project

**Eclipse Cargo Tracker - Applied Domain-Driven Design Blueprints for Jakarta EE**

The project demonstrates how you can develop applications with Jakarta EE using widely adopted architectural best practices like Domain-Driven Design (DDD). The project is directly based on the well known original Java DDD sample application developed by DDD pioneer Eric Evans' company Domain Language and the Swedish software consulting company Citerus. The cargo example actually comes from Eric Evans' seminal book on DDD. The original application is written in Spring, Hibernate and Jetty whereas the application is built on Jakarta EE.

The application is an end-to-end system for keeping track of shipping cargo. It has several interfaces described in the following sections.

A slide deck introducing the fundamentals of the project is available on the official Eclipse Foundation Jakarta EE SlideShare account. A recording of the slide deck is available on the official Jakarta EE YouTube account.
